# FlashDetector
Console app for detecting .gif files that may trigger seizures in individuals with photosensitive epilepsy.

Approximately 3.5 million Americans suffer from epilepsy, including this author. In 3-5% of cases, certain visual patterns can trigger seizures. Although there are other manifestations, the most well-known of them is rapidly flashing lights. The problem is widespread enough that in 1998 Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to include accessibility mandates for all federally-produced electronic content (https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies#Software). 

Malicious actors have even used flashing gifs as weapons. In 2016, a prominent reporter was sent multiple ones on Twitter after his criticism of President Donald Trump (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/20/newsweek-kurt-eichenwald-twitter-epilepsy-seizure). The man who sent them was later identified and charged with aggravated assault (https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2019/12/13/assault-by-twitter-guilty-plea-expected-in-attack-targeting-dallas-author-kurt-eichenwald/).
